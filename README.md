# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

This is a simple web application built using **Flask** that recommends the best crop to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions using a Machine Learning model.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Takes user inputs such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.
- Predicts the most suitable crop using a pre-trained ML model.
- Uses MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for preprocessing the input features.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model

The ML model (`model.pkl`) is trained to classify the best crop from the following list:

> Rice, Maize, Jute, Cotton, Coconut, Papaya, Orange, Apple, Muskmelon, Watermelon, Grapes, Mango, Banana, Pomegranate, Lentil, Blackgram, Mungbean, Mothbeans, Pigeonpeas, Kidneybeans, Chickpea, Coffee
